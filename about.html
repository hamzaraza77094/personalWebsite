            <p>Hi, my name is Hamza Raza and I am a student at Texas A&M University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am a motivated individual with a passion for both programming and leadership. I have a GPA of 3.442 and have taken various relevant courses in computer science such as Discrete Structures Computing, Data Structures and Algorithms, Program Design and Concepts, and Database Systems. <br><br>

              I have had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through internships, both in Deloitte and Varsity Tutors. At Deloitte, I worked on a M&A Case Study Competition and was able to implement my recommendations while also ensuring the company's compliance with government regulations. Additionally, I was able to learn about the machine learning tax software Altryx and attend Deloitte University to further my industry knowledge. Through my work as a tutor at Varsity Tutors, I was able to provide regular instructional sessions in programming, math, and English and received high satisfaction rates from my clients.<br><br>
              
              I am also a leader in the community and founded the Young Muslims College Station organization. Through this organization, I was able to create a Muslim leadership program for college students, secure funding, coordinate keynote speaker events, collaborate with local community initiatives, and raise money for middle eastern charities. <br><br>
              
              In addition to my leadership skills, I have also worked on various programming projects. I have developed a task app that tracks productivity using Tkinter, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. I have also created a username and password database and a To-Do list app that utilizes SQLite3 and Tkinter. Another project I am proud of is my seam carving algorithm that recognizes the energy of a pixel within an image and decipher which pixels are relevant to the image. Additionally, I have created a portfolio website and have worked with REST APIs and JSON in Python.<br><br>
              
              I have a strong skill set in programming languages such as C++, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, C, Java, Git, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Verilog, Scheme, Altryx, Onesource, JSON, and REST APIs. I am always eager to learn and grow in my field and believe that my passion for programming, leadership skills, and hands-on experience make me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
