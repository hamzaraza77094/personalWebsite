            <p>I've always been passionate about bringing people together and creating a sense of community. This is what led me to start up Young Muslims (YM) in College Station. It all started with a group of friends who wanted to connect with other young Muslims in the area. We would gather for prayers and social events, and before long, our group had grown to include over 50 members.<br><br>

                I was inspired by the success of YM in College Station and decided to take the initiative to start a similar organization in MAS Katy. In 2019, I founded YM in MAS Katy and was thrilled to see it grow rapidly. To this day, YM in MAS Katy continues to thrive and brings together over 50 members every week. It's amazing to see how the organization has continued to grow and bring people together, even after I've moved on.<br><br>
                
                YM is more than just a social club, it's a place where young Muslims can come together to build meaningful relationships, participate in religious activities, and give back to the community. It's truly been a privilege to be a part of this organization and see the positive impact it has on its members. I'm proud of what we've accomplished and am grateful for the opportunity to have made a difference in the lives of so many young Muslims.</p>
