                <li class="paragraph">During my time at Deloitte as a Discovery Tax Intern, I had the opportunity to work on a M&A case study competition. My role involved implementing recommendations, analyzing financial statements between two companies, and ensuring that the post-acquisition company was in compliance with government regulations. I was also able to shadow employees in Tax Technology Consulting, learn about the machine learning tax software Altryx, and attend Deloitte University, where I gained insight into industry practices and leadership.<br><br>

                    I was introduced to the Indirect/Direct Onesource and the User Interface that Deloitte implements for its clients. I gained a strong understanding of the conceptual and practical aspects of the software, which I believe will be a valuable asset in my future endeavors. Additionally, I learned about the importance of creating a network and working as a cohesive team through attending Deloitte University.<br><br>
                    
                    Overall, my experience at Deloitte was a valuable learning opportunity that exposed me to the real-world applications of my coursework, and allowed me to gain hands-on experience in the tax technology field.</li>
                <ul class="">
                    <li class="title"><h1>Credera</h1></li>
                </ul>
                <li class="paragraph">I am enthusiastic about joining Credera as a Technology Solutions Consultant intern this summer. As a computer science student, I am eager to apply my technical knowledge and skills to real-world database problems. I look forward to learning from my colleagues, contributing to the team, and making a positive impact on projects. This internship offers a unique chance to grow both professionally and personally, and I am eager to make the most of it.</li>
                <ul class="">
                    <li class="title"><h1>Github</h1></li>
                </ul>
                <li class="paragraph">As a computer science student at Texas A&M University, I have a strong passion for technology and its potential to change the world. My education and experience have equipped me with a diverse range of technical skills in programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I have also developed proficiency in tools such as Git, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib, Verilog, Scheme, Altryx, Onesource, JSON, and RestAPIs.<br><br>

                    My projects on GitHub showcase my technical abilities and my commitment to developing practical and efficient solutions. My Task App tracks and records productivity using Tkinter, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. I also created a username/password database and login system using SQLite3 and Tkinter for a To-Do list-based app. Additionally, I developed a Seam Carving algorithm to manipulate images and a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My News API project demonstrates my ability to request and parse information from multiple sources, connecting the API to a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.</li>
