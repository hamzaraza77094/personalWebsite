      <h2>About Chat GPT</h2>
      <p>Chat GPT is a conversational AI model developed by OpenAI. It uses advanced deep learning algorithms to generate human-like responses to prompts and questions. Chat GPT can be used for a wide range of applications, including customer service, content creation, and more. It's capable of generating answers to questions, completing tasks, and even creating websites, like this one!</p>

    <section class="how-it-was-made">
      <h2>How this Page was Made</h2>
      <p>This page was generated by Chat GPT in response to the prompt given by the user. Chat GPT analyzed the code and pattern in the files provided by the user, and used that information to create a unique and interesting website page that follows the style and pattern of the code. The interactive feature of the page originally asked for a prompt, but that was replaced with a summarization of the prompt given by the user.</p>

      <h2>Dynamic Background Color</h2>
      <p>Each time this page is refreshed, a new background color is generated. This is done through a JavaScript function that generates a random RGB value and sets it as the background color of the page. Try refreshing the page to see a new background color!</p>
